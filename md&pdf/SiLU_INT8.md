## Output Details
- `Latency`: refers to the [min, max, mean, median, 99% percentile] of the engine latency measurements, when timing the engine w/o profiling layers.
- `Throughput`: is measured in query (inference) per second (QPS).
- `Enqueue Time`: Time taken to enqueue inference requests.
- `H2D Latency`: Host-to-Device latency (data transfer time).
- `GPU Compute Time`: Time spent computing on the GPU.
- `D2H Latency`: Device-to-Host latency (data transfer time).
- `Total Host Walltime`
- `Total GPU Compute Time`
